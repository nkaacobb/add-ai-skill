# Changelog

All notable changes to the ai-enablement skill (named add-ai-skill up to 1.6, ai-agent-drawer before 1.1). It
installs, upgrades and extends an application's AI layer: the agent drawer runtime and the app's capability folder. The
skill's version is in `package.json`; the runtime (`VERSION` in `assets/ai-agent/ai-agent.js`) and the relays
(`AIA_RELAY_VERSION` / `RELAY_VERSION`) carry their own, which only change when their code does.
`scripts/release-hashes.json` fingerprints every released runtime and relay.

## 2.0.0 — AI Enablement: tools, toolsets, skills, agents, permissions, lifecycle, in-app authoring (runtime 1.6.0; relays unchanged at 1.4.0)

The skill is now **ai-enablement**. It still builds the agent drawer into an app, and it now manages the app's whole
AI layer: first-class tools and toolsets (MCP-compatible), Agent Skills, agents, permissions, a capability folder the
runtime loads, a lifecycle (install → upgrade → validate → add → reconcile) with a manifest, and a development
workspace in which the app's own agent writes new tools. Every 1.5 option and method keeps working; apps built with
add-ai-skill are recognised and upgrade normally. Design notes: `docs/ai-enablement-design.md` in the repository.

### Rename

- The skill folder, its name and its installed copies are `ai-enablement`. The installer no longer removes other
  installed skills: `add-ai-skill` copies stay until removed on purpose (`-RemoveLegacy` / `--remove-legacy`).
- Unchanged on purpose, so installed apps and relays keep working: `ai-agent.js`, `createAiAgent`, the `aia-` CSS
  prefix, `ai-tools.json`, `ai-memory.json`, and the relay protocol (`X-Requested-With: ai-agent-drawer`,
  `"relay": "ai-agent-drawer"`).

### Runtime 1.6.0

- **Capability folder**: `createAiAgent({ capabilities: 'ai/index.json', host })` loads an index naming tool modules,
  toolsets, skills, agents, permissions, the tool config and the memory file (`core/capabilities.js`).
  `agent.capabilities.reload()` loads it again (fresh copies of every module and file, the tool config re-applied).
  Problems are collected — console, `agent.capabilities.problems()` — never thrown.
- **Tools**: a JSON Schema `inputSchema` (MCP) as an alternative to `parameters` (the enforceable subset; the rest is
  refused with the reason — `core/schema.js`); `minLength`, `pattern`, `minItems` enforced; MCP `annotations`
  accepted and derived; `agent.tools.mcp()` / `toMcpTool()` export MCP descriptors; `run(args, { host, … })` gets the
  integration's `host`; new effects `external` and `system`.
- **Toolsets**: modules export `{ name, title, description, tools }`; JSON toolsets group tools defined elsewhere;
  Settings > Tools groups by them; `agent.tools.toolsets()`.
- **Permissions** (`core/permissions.js`): `{ allow, ask, deny }` rules (names, `*`, `toolset:`, `effect:`) from the
  index, the `permissions` option and the active agent; deny > ask > allow > the user's settings; `system` tools always
  confirm. Denied tools never reach the model; Settings > Tools shows *blocked*, *always asks*, *no confirmation*.
- **Skills** (`core/skills.js`, Agent Skills format): listed in the system prompt; the model loads one with
  `use_skill` (then it stays in the system prompt for the conversation, saved with the chat); `/name` in the composer;
  `read_skill_file` for the files a skill points to. `agent.skills.list()`, `activate()`, `active()`.
- **Agents** (`core/agents.js`): Markdown files with YAML frontmatter composing instructions, tools, toolsets, skills,
  permissions, context layers, memory policy and step limits. A picker replaces the drawer title when there are two
  or more; switching starts a new chat; saved chats remember their agent. `agent.agents.list()`, `current()`, `use()`.
- **In-app authoring** (`workspace` option, `core/workspace.js`): when the skill's dev server answers, the agent gets
  `describe_host`, `list_source_files`, `read_source_file`, `search_source`, `write_ai_file` (effect `system`: always
  confirmed, shown whole or as a diff; creating an existing file is refused; a module without `export default` or with
  `run(args, host)` is refused with the fix), `reload_capabilities` (reports unregistered tool files and misnamed tool
  config keys) and the built-in skill `create-tool` (`skills/create-tool/SKILL.md`, shipped in the runtime).
- Tools may refuse a call before the confirmation card (`precheck`); `confirmHtml` may be async.
- New exports: `toMcpTool`, `fromJsonSchema`, `loadCapabilities`, `parseSkill`, `parseAgent`, `parseFrontmatter`.
  New events: `agent`, `skill`, `capabilities`, `workspace`.
- `agent.ready` also waits for the capability index and the workspace check.

### Skill

- `SKILL.md` is a lifecycle router: detect → install / upgrade / validate → add a capability.
- New references: `framework.md` (concepts, formats, ownership, permissions, the manifest), `capabilities.md`
  (create a tool / toolset / skill / agent, context, memory), `in-app-authoring.md`. Updated: `tools.md` (toolset
  modules, `host`, `inputSchema`, effects), `upgrading.md` (adopting the framework, the 1.6 changes, the manifest),
  `api.md`, `architecture.md`, `checklist.md`, `frameworks.md` (where the capability folder goes per stack),
  `memory-and-vision.md`.
- **Manifest** `ai-enablement.json` replaces `ai-agent.integration.json` (still read): `framework` (runtime and relay
  — framework-owned) and `capabilities` sections.
- Scripts: `detect.mjs` (capability folders and missing paths, the manifest or the 1.x record, dev-time folders kept
  apart, the new features, a relay compared with the skill's own relay version — a 1.4 relay is no longer reported as
  an upgrade because the runtime is 1.5, — `createAiAgent` mentioned in comments no longer counted); new
  `validate.mjs`, `scaffold.mjs` (templates in `assets/templates/`), `workspace.mjs`; `verify.mjs` has a
  *capabilities* check.
- Hello World runs on the framework: `ai/index.json`, three toolset modules (`document`, `editor` — its tool written
  as JSON Schema — `file`), skills `proofreading` (with a reference file) and `summarize`, agents `writer` and
  `proofreader`, an `ask` rule for the file toolset, `ai-enablement.json`; `ai-tools.js` became the toolset modules.
- Tests: `framework`, `framework-browser` (agents, skills, permissions, saved chats; in-app authoring end to end with a
  scripted model), `workspace`, `lifecycle`; `detect` and `example` extended. Also tried live with LM Studio and
  `qwen/qwen3.5-9b`: the in-app agent added working tools from a plain request.

### Upgrading from 1.6 (add-ai-skill) / runtime 1.5

1. Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` (new files in `core/` and `skills/`). The relays are unchanged.
2. Behaviour to know about (`references/upgrading.md`, U4): `host` in tool contexts; the AGENT and SKILLS prompt
   sections (only with agents or skills); permission badges; the agent picker; `agent` and `skills` in saved chats;
   the new `$comment` of exported tool configs.
3. Write `ai-enablement.json` from `ai-agent.integration.json` (`references/upgrading.md`, "The manifest").
4. Offer, do not force, the capability folder (`references/upgrading.md`, "Adopting the framework") — and with it
   skills, agents, permissions and in-app authoring where they fit.

## 1.6.0 — attachments: the + button (runtime 1.5.0; relays unchanged at 1.4.0)

The user can give the agent an image or a document with the question. A **+** button on the left of the message field
opens a menu: **Attach an image** and **Upload a file**. Drag and drop onto the drawer and pasting attach the same way.
All 1.5 options and methods keep working; the relays need no change.

### Images

- An attached image goes to the model **exactly like a screenshot**: the same pipeline (`imageFromFile()` in
  `ui/capture.js`) makes a JPEG of at most `screenshotMaxEdge` px and a thumbnail; it waits in the composer, shows on the
  question (click to enlarge), counts toward the 3 images per question, and follows the screenshot rules (the two
  newest questions with images send them; saved chats keep thumbnails only).
- The model is told which images are screenshots and which are files, by name (`[Attached to this message: a
  screenshot of the user's screen (…) and the image file "diagram.png".]`). Questions with screenshots only keep the
  1.4 wording.
- Offered while "This model can see images" is on; otherwise *Attach an image* is greyed out with the reason, and an
  image dropped or picked anyway gets a message saying how to enable it (an SVG is then read as text).

### Files

- Read **in the browser, without dependencies**, and sent as text inside `<attached_file name="…" type="…"
  chars="…">` blocks (a closing tag inside the file is neutralised):
  - **PDF** (`core/pdf.js`): page tree, fonts with ToUnicode maps or encodings (WinAnsi, MacRoman, Differences with
    glyph names), Flate/ASCII filters and PNG predictors, object streams, form XObjects, inline images skipped; line
    breaks and spaces from text positions; pages marked `--- Page N ---`. Checked on PDFs from Word-style tools,
    LaTeX-style manuals, CJK licence texts and the browser's own print-to-PDF. Encrypted and scanned (text-less) PDFs
    are refused with a sentence that says so.
  - **Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OpenDocument, RTF** (`core/office.js` over a small ZIP reader in `core/bytes.js`):
    headings and list items, tables as rows, footnotes, text boxes once (not their fallback copy); one CSV section per
    sheet with dates from their number format; slides in presentation order with speaker notes; RTF in its code pages.
  - **Text** of any kind (code, CSV, JSON, Markdown, logs, config): UTF-8, UTF-16 with a BOM, else Windows-1252; files
    with unknown extensions are read when their content is text.
  - Refused with what to do instead: old binary Office files, iWork, archives, audio/video, other binaries, empty
    files, files over 25 MB.
- Each file's text is cut to **Max file content** (Settings > Agent; setting `maxFileChars`, 40,000 by default) and
  the model is told. 5 files per question. A file stays in the conversation while its question is in the history
  window; the same content attached again is sent once. Saved chats keep a file's text (dropped from older chats
  first when storage runs out).
- The chip on the question opens **the text the agent received**.
- The system prompt gains an *Attached files* paragraph only while the conversation carries files.
- The PDF and office readers load with `import()` on first use, so start-up cost does not grow.

### API

- Options `attachments` (default `true`; `false` removes the + button, drop and paste) and `readFile(file, { kind,
  name })` — the app's own reader, tried first (text, `{ text, label }`, or `null` for the built-in readers).
- `agent.attach(files)` → one `{ kind, name, size, … }` (or `null`) per file; event `attach`; `send` carries `images`
  and `files`. Setting `maxFileChars`.
- `agent.ask(text)` and the welcome suggestions take what waits in the composer along, as Send does.
- New modules: `core/files.js`, `core/bytes.js`, `core/pdf.js`, `core/office.js`.

### Skill workflow

- `SKILL.md`: the feature, an *Attachments* line in the context plan, step 9 "Memory, vision and attachments",
  verification and report. `references/memory-and-vision.md` has an *Attachments* section (formats, limits, what to
  do in an integration, `readFile`, CSP `blob:` for SVGs, relays); `api.md`, `upgrading.md` (U4–U6, the record's
  `attachments` feature), `checklist.md` (checks and troubleshooting), `architecture.md`, `providers.md`.
- `scripts/detect.mjs` reports the `attachments` feature, and flags app code that reads files for the agent itself.
  `scripts/verify.mjs` has an `attachments` check (the menu, one attached text file).
- The skill description now mentions attachments and is shorter than before.
- Tests: `tests/files.test.mjs` with documents built in memory (`tests/fixtures/documents.mjs`: DOCX, XLSX, PPTX, ODF,
  RTF, PDFs with WinAnsi/Differences and Type0/ToUnicode fonts, object streams, forms); in a real browser the + menu
  with the keyboard, an image and a Word file through the pickers and what the model receives, the file viewer, saved
  chats, drag and drop, paste, a text-only model, `attach()` + `ask()`, Send while a file is read, `attachments:
  false`, and a PDF printed by the browser itself.

### Upgrading from 1.5

1. Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` (four new files in `core/`). The relays are unchanged.
2. Behaviour changes to know about (`references/upgrading.md`, U4):
   - The composer has a + button (`.aia-plus`) left of the field; drops on the drawer no longer reach host `drop`
     listeners; pasted files are attached (a paste that carries text pastes the text).
   - `agent.ask()` takes the composer's attachments along.
   - The system prompt's image paragraph starts "Images:" (was "Screenshots:"); tests matching the old text change.
   - `screenshots: false` keeps Settings > Vision while attachments are on.
3. Set `defaults.maxFileChars` lower for a default model with a small context; remove app-side "send a file to the
   agent" code (detect flags it), keeping a reader for the app's own formats as `readFile`.

## 1.5.0 — tool-call diagnostics (runtime and relays 1.4.0)

When a tool call fails, the user can now see why, and the model is told what really went wrong. Found with LM Studio
and `qwen/qwen3.5-9b` (a model that thinks first, at the default *Max reply tokens* of 4,096) writing a long note list
in one JSON-string argument: the reply was cut off mid-arguments, the lenient parser made up a value from the broken
JSON, the model was told *missing required argument "notes"*, and it "fixed" its quoting over and over. All 1.4 options
and methods keep working.

### Cut-off replies

- Every adapter reports `truncated: true` when the reply stopped at the max-tokens limit: OpenAI-compatible
  `finish_reason: "length"` (streamed or not), Anthropic `stop_reason: "max_tokens"`, Gemini `finishReason:
  "MAX_TOKENS"`, the relay's `done.truncated`. `streamChat()` passes it on.
- A cut-off call is **not run**. Its row says *Cut off: the reply reached Max reply tokens (4,096 tokens) after N
  characters of arguments. Raise it in Settings > Agent, or ask for less per step.*; the model is told to do the work
  in several smaller calls. A cut-off reply without tool calls shows a notice. In text mode an unclosed ```` ```tool ````
  block becomes that cut-off call, but only when the reply was truncated.

### Arguments

- `readArguments(value) → { args, error }` (`core/tools.js`): JSON first (trailing commas forgiven), `key: value` lines
  only when the result is not garbled, and JSON that stops before it is closed is reported as cut off. A call whose
  arguments cannot be read is reported to the model, never run with guessed values. `parseArguments()` keeps its
  contract (an object; `{}` for unreadable text).
- Tool calls carry `raw` (the argument text as the model wrote it) and `argsError`; `wireCall()` strips both before
  calls go back to the provider.
- Text over a string parameter's `maxLength` (default 500) is an error with both sizes ("`notes` is 12,981 characters
  long, over its limit of 12,000: send less in one call"), never cut into broken JSON. Tool arguments only:
  `parseBlockValues` and fenced blocks still cut, as before.

### Tool rows roll down

- The row's line is a button: once the call is over, clicking it rolls down the problem (if any), *Arguments the tool
  received*, *As the model sent them* (only when different), *Returned to the model* / *Error returned to the model*,
  and a **Copy** button. Every finished row does, including the built-in tools and the *Turn on* request.
- **Copy tool log** under a reply with tool rows copies every row as text.
- Saved chats keep the detail (each part capped at 2,000 characters), so reopened chats roll down too. Saved action
  records gain `name` and `detail: { args, sent, problem, result }`.
- New `core/tools.js` exports: `readArguments`, `jsonUnclosed`, `toolCall`, `wireCall`, `argumentsProblem`,
  `callDetail`, `callReport`, `STATUS_WORDS`; `parseTextToolCalls(text, idPrefix, { cutOff })`.

### Relays (1.4.0)

- `tool_call` events carry `raw` (the arguments as the model wrote them); `done` carries `truncated: true` when the
  reply hit the max-tokens limit. `relay.php` tracks the finish reason of all three protocols. An older relay keeps
  working: a cut-off call then reads as "could not be read" rather than "cut off".

### Skill workflow

- `references/tools.md`: the `maxLength` rule, rows that roll down, cut-off detection, and tools that take large
  payloads in sections (`offset` / `part`) so one call fits in one reply. Step 8 of `SKILL.md` says the same.
- Tests: `tests/tool-calls.test.mjs` (argument reading, limits, cut-off detection per provider and through the relay
  adapter, text mode, row detail), relay tests for `raw` / `truncated` (Node + PHP), and in a real browser a cut-off
  call rolled down, copied and reopened from a saved chat.

### Upgrading from 1.4

1. Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` and the relay.
2. Behaviour changes to know about (`references/upgrading.md`, U4):
   - A string tool parameter without `maxLength` now refuses text over 500 characters instead of cutting it. Give
     every parameter that takes long text an explicit `maxLength`.
   - Unreadable arguments are an error the model sees, not a best guess.
   - Tool calls from the adapters and `streamChat()` carry `raw` (and `argsError`).
   - The tool row's line is a `<button>` (it was a `div`): check app CSS that styles `.aia-tool-line`.
3. For a model that thinks before it answers, raise *Max reply tokens* (`defaults.maxOutputTokens`) if its tool calls
   carry a lot of data.

## 1.4.0 — memory and vision (runtime and relays 1.3.0)

The agent remembers what it is asked to remember, and can look at the screen. Both are part of the runtime: an app
gets them by replacing its runtime copy, and the skill adds the app-specific part. All 1.2 options and methods keep
working.

### Memory

- Notes kept between conversations: the user says "remember that…", the model calls the built-in `remember` tool, the
  chat shows a chip with **Undo**; `forget` deletes one after the user confirms. The notes are a `== MEMORY ==`
  section of every system prompt, marked as notes that lose against the screen.
- **Settings > Memory**: the list (edit, delete, add), *Download ai-memory.json*, *Copy JSON*, *Import a file…*,
  *Delete all*, and two switches (use memories; let the agent save them).
- `memoryFile` (`ai-memory.json`): the app's starting notes. A browser stores only what differs from the file (its own
  notes, edits, deletions), so a later file still reaches users. `memorySave(file)` lets an app's backend keep them.
- `agent.memory` (`list`, `add`, `update`, `remove`, `clear`, `export`, `import`), the `memory` event, the settings
  `memoryEnabled` / `memoryWrite`, `memory: false` to remove it. Limits: 100 notes of 500 characters.

### Vision

- A **camera button** beside Send attaches a screenshot of what the user is looking at (a thumbnail in the composer,
  then on the question); the model receives it as an image.
- The agent's own `take_screenshot` tool, callable only when the user frees it (Settings > Vision: untick "Only take
  a screenshot when I press the camera button"). Otherwise the agent can ask, and the user gets *Allow once* /
  *Always allow* / *No*. Every screenshot the agent takes shows as a thumbnail on its chip.
- **Settings > Vision**: "This model can see images" (off: no camera button, no screenshots), the camera-only switch,
  how screenshots are taken here, *Stop sharing this tab*; with LM Studio, what the server says about the loaded model.
- Two ways to take the picture: the browser's screen capture of the tab (default: the whole page as displayed, drawer
  cropped off; the browser asks the user) or the app's `screenshot` hook (a canvas, image, video frame, Blob…; no
  prompt; a WebGL canvas returned right after a render is read before its buffer is cleared).
- JPEG scaled to `screenshotMaxEdge` (1280 px); only the two newest questions with screenshots send their images;
  saved chats keep thumbnails only. `agent.screenshot()`, the `screenshot` event, the settings `vision` /
  `screenshotAuto`, `screenshots: false` to remove it.
- Images in all three provider formats (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Gemini) and in text-mode tool results. Checked
  live with a vision model on LM Studio; Anthropic and Gemini follow their documented formats (unit-tested, not run live).

### Relays (1.3.0)

- `relay.php` and `relay.mjs` check and pass `images` on user messages and tool results: `limits.maxImages` (public 4,
  local 16; 0 refuses images) and `maxImageBytes` (public 1.5 MB, local 4 MB, as base64), on top of `maxBodyBytes`,
  which stays the cap for the text. The GET reply has `images` and, from the preset, `vision`.
- The drawer asks a relay once before the first request with an image, and refuses the question with a clear message
  when the relay is older than 1.3 (it would drop the image silently). With `relayProbe`, such a relay switches vision off.
- `relay.php` answers 413 with the reason when a body is larger than PHP's `post_max_size` (PHP discards such bodies).

### Skill workflow

- New step 9, **Memory and vision**, and `references/memory-and-vision.md`: collecting the seed notes, `ai-memory.json`,
  where users' notes live, choosing the capture method, hook recipes (2D, WebGL, layered canvases), host requirements
  (secure context, `Permissions-Policy`, CSP), relay limits, privacy.
- `scripts/detect.mjs` reports, per feature (tools, memory, vision), whether the installed runtime has it and whether
  the integration uses it, plus canvases/WebGL views and policy headers that matter for screenshots — so an upgrade
  adds only what is missing. `references/upgrading.md` has the steps for an app at 1.2 or older.
- `scripts/verify.mjs`: `memory` and `vision` checks (it takes one screenshot the way the camera button does).
- Hello World ships `ai-memory.json`.
- Tests: the memory store and prompt, images per provider and in the conversation, relay image limits (Node + PHP),
  and in a real browser: remember / forget / Undo / Settings > Memory, a WebGL `screenshot` hook, the agent asking to
  look, and the browser's screen capture with the drawer cropped off.

### Upgrading from 1.2

1. Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` and the relay. Memory and vision are then on with their defaults.
2. Add what the app lacks (`references/upgrading.md`, "Adding memory and vision"): `ai-memory.json` + `memoryFile`,
   and a `screenshot` hook where the view is a canvas. Set `defaults: { vision: false }` for a text-only default model.
3. Behaviour changes to know about:
   - Requests now carry tool definitions even in apps without tools (`remember`, `forget`, and `request_tool` while
     the agent may not look on its own). A model server without tool calling gets them as text blocks automatically.
     `memory: false` and `screenshots: false` give exactly the 1.2 requests.
   - The default composer placeholder is shorter ("Ask about what is on screen…").
   - A relay must be 1.3 for screenshots; its body cap for text is unchanged, images come on top. Raise
     `client_max_body_size` / `post_max_size` in front of it.
   - A page with a `Content-Security-Policy` needs `img-src data:` for the thumbnails.

## 1.3.0 — upgrade mode (runtime and relays unchanged: 1.2.0)

Running the skill on an app that already has the agent now upgrades it instead of building a second one.

- **Step 0** in SKILL.md: run `scripts/detect.mjs` first. It finds the runtime copy and its version, says whether the
  copy is unchanged since its release (fingerprints for 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 1.2.0), finds relays (with 1.0-style edits:
  constants, keys or auth code inside the file — never printing keys), relay config files (names only), every
  `createAiAgent()` call with its `appId` and options, the integration record, tool configs, and app code that looks
  like a workaround a newer runtime covers. It ends with BUILD, UPGRADE or CURRENT.
- **`references/upgrading.md`**: the upgrade workflow — read the record and the CHANGELOG since the installed
  version, propose the upgrade, replace the runtime and relay wholesale (migrating 1.0 relay constants to
  `relay.config.php`), remove redundant workarounds (table), offer the new features that fit (tools first), verify,
  and record. Keeps the `appId`, hooks, prompts and customisations.
- **`ai-agent.integration.json`**: every integration and upgrade leaves a record in the app (versions, files,
  features, plans, declined features), so the next run knows exactly what is there.
- `scripts/release-hashes.mjs` records the fingerprints of a release (maintainers: run it for every release).
- Tests: `tests/detect.test.mjs`.

## 1.2.0 — the agent can act: tools

The agent no longer only explains and suggests: it calls the application's own functions. All 1.1 options and
methods keep working; an app without `tools` behaves exactly as before.

### Skill workflow

- Survey step: the app's **action surface** (API clients, store actions, services, handlers, controls with ranges).
- Context plan: a **tool plan** per page (what each tool wraps, read / write / destructive, parameters, what is left
  out), with the user choosing which tools start on.
- New step "Build the tools" and `references/tools.md`: one tools module over the app's own functions, `ai-tools.json`
  for the default selection, unit tests, and checks with a model.

### Runtime

- `tools` option, `page.tools`, `toolsConfig` (e.g. `'ai-tools.json'`), and `agent.tools` (`list`, `register`,
  `unregister`, `setEnabled`, `run`, `exportConfig`); events `tool` and `tool-state`.
- The tool loop: native tool calls for OpenAI-compatible servers (LM Studio, Ollama, OpenAI, DeepSeek, OpenRouter,
  custom), Anthropic and Gemini; a text-block protocol for models without tool calling (`toolMode`); arguments
  validated and clamped; results (and the screen, if it changed) sent back; up to `maxToolSteps` rounds.
- Confirmations: write tools ask (*Run* / *Allow for this chat* / *Skip*), destructive tools always ask — both
  switchable (`confirmWrites`, `confirmDestructive`). Reading tools never ask.
- Turned-off tools stay known to the model: it can say so and ask with the built-in `request_tool`, which shows a
  *Turn on* button; turning a tool on saves the choice.
- **Settings > Tools**: a checkbox per tool (grouped, with its effect and availability), the switches, and
  "Download ai-tools.json" to make the selection the app's default. Only choices that differ from the app's defaults
  are stored.
- Chips for every call in the reply; actions kept in saved chats and summarised in later requests.
- Settings > Context counts the tool definitions in the size estimate; the Context tab's system prompt includes the
  TOOLS section.
- Some local models (seen with LM Studio + Qwen 3.5 9B) answer the step after a tool round only in their reasoning
  channel: that reasoning is shown as the answer.

### Relays (1.2.0)

- `relay.php` and `relay.mjs` pass `tools` and `toolTurns` to the provider (all three protocols) and stream
  `tool_call` events. Public mode counts one question per chain of tool steps (`turnId`) up to `limits.maxToolSteps`;
  a forged continuation is counted. New limits `maxTools` (64) and `maxToolSteps` (public 10, local 30).

### Tooling

- `scripts/verify.mjs` reports the tool catalog and runs the reading tools that need no arguments.
- Hello World: eight tools over the editor's functions (`ai-tools.js`) and `ai-tools.json`.
- Tests: tool unit tests, adapter tool formats, relay tool pass-through (Node + PHP), the full drawer tool loop in a
  real browser (confirmation, turn-on, text mode), Hello World's tools.

### Upgrading from 1.1

Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` and the relay. Nothing else changes until you add `tools`. A 1.1 relay ignores tools, so
upgrade the relay too if the app uses one.

## 1.1.0 — lessons from the first production integration

The skill is now named **add-ai-skill** (was `ai-agent-drawer`): install it with the repository's
`install-skill.ps1` / `install-skill.sh`, which also remove copies installed under the old name. What it puts into
apps keeps its names: the `ai-agent/` runtime folder, the `aia-` CSS prefix, and the relay protocol identifiers
(`X-Requested-With: ai-agent-drawer`, `"relay": "ai-agent-drawer"`), so existing integrations and relays keep working.

A WebGL simulation fed by a Web Worker (~10 state updates/s), native `<dialog>` modals, a dense fixed-width header,
developed on XAMPP and deployed on Nginx + PHP-FPM. Everything it needed app-side workarounds for is now built in or
documented. All 1.0 options and methods keep working.

### Runtime

- **`contextChanged()` no longer starves under continuous updates**: a trailing debounce with a max wait
  (`debounceMaxMs`, default 1000). Before, an app changing state every ~100 ms never let the 300 ms debounce fire.
- **Key isolation** (`isolateKeys`, default on): key events that start inside the drawer or the settings modal do not
  reach the host's bubbling listeners, so host shortcuts (Space = play, letters, arrows) cannot swallow typing.
  Ctrl/Cmd application shortcuts still reach the host; the hotkey and Escape work from inside the drawer.
- **Native modal dialogs** (`dialogs: 'dock'`, opt-in): dialogs are shown non-modally beside the open drawer and
  become modal again when it closes, without `close`/`beforetoggle`/`toggle` events reaching the host.
- **Dev-time warnings** (`devWarnings`, default on for local hosts): the pushed layout overflows or hides elements
  (including the toggle) under the drawer; a modal dialog makes the drawer inert.
- **Theming**: the theme rules are wrapped in `:where()`, so host `.aia-scope { --aia-… }` overrides win in dark
  mode too. New `--aia-badge-synced/-dirty/-unread/-ring/-size/-top/-right` variables for the toggle's context dot
  (defaults unchanged). New `--aia-push-width` host hook. `html.aia-drawer-open` and `--aia-drawer-width` are now
  documented, supported hooks.
- **Code actions that survive small models**: `parseBlockValues(block, { tags, schema })` (custom tag, or `json` when
  every key is known; JSON or `key: value` lines; linear-time parsing; clamping) and `setControlValue(el, value)`
  (applies through the app's real controls: native setter + `input`/`change`).
- **Relay auto-detection**: `relayProbe` (GET the relay at startup, use it when `available`, with its preset) and
  async `defaults` (promise or async function). New `agent.ready`, `agent.relayInfo()`, `relay` event. Saved settings
  that no longer fit the relay are adjusted when read, without touching storage.
- **Resume**: a drawer reopened during `createAiAgent()` replays its `open` event (`{ resumed: true }`) to listeners
  registered in the same tick. The composer no longer takes focus from a settings modal opened right after the drawer.
- **Context size**: Settings > Context shows the estimated tokens of the first request and warns (local providers)
  above `contextWarnTokens` (3000).
- Relay errors keep their own code and message in the drawer (a refused origin is no longer shown as "check your
  API key"); `detail` is appended when the relay sends one.

### Relays

- `relay.php` and `relay.mjs` are configured by a **config file** (`relay.config.example.php`; `.json`/`.mjs` for
  Node), looked up in `AIA_RELAY_CONFIG`, then `AIA_RELAY_DIR` (default: `ai-agent-relay` next to the web root), then
  next to the relay. Apps copy the relay unchanged.
- **Public mode**: only the configured preset (provider, models, server key); visitor keys never forwarded;
  same-origin enforced (`X-Requested-With`, `Origin`, `Sec-Fetch-Site`, no CORS headers); per-visitor per-minute and
  per-day limits plus a site-wide daily cap (salted, daily-rotating hashes; IPv6 by /64; no addresses or text stored);
  body, message-count and reply-token caps.
- Streams start with `: open` and send `: keepalive` comments every ~15 s while the model is silent (Nginx
  `fastcgi_read_timeout`; also detects a visitor's Stop). `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, `apache_setenv('no-gzip')`.
- Typed errors with HTTP status and drawer error code; misconfiguration details only for requests from the server
  itself. `GET` always answers 200 (`available: false` instead of 403). Keys from `getenv()` and `$_SERVER`
  (`fastcgi_param`), then the config. `caBundle: 'native'` for Windows certificate stores (TLS-scanning antivirus).
- `relay.mjs` exports `createRelay`, `loadConfig`, `createStaticHandler`; its static server never serves
  `relay.config.*` or dotfiles.

### Tooling and docs

- `scripts/verify.mjs`: automated integration check in headless Edge/Chrome (no dependencies; Node 22+).
- Tests: `tests/relay.test.mjs` (both relays, fake upstream), `tests/browser.test.mjs` (real browser),
  `tests/example.test.mjs`; new unit tests in `tests/runtime.test.mjs`.
- Hello World now loads its integration with `import()` (`ai-agent-setup.js`), builds its content in a pure tested
  module (`content.js`), and has an "Apply editor settings" code action using the new helpers.
- References: real-time apps, content builders, keyboard shortcuts, modal dialogs, layout recipe, change signals,
  small-model code actions, stale caches, local model context size, relay modes/config, Nginx + PHP-FPM and
  Apache/XAMPP deployment, TLS trust.

### Upgrading an app from 1.0

1. Re-copy `assets/ai-agent/` (unchanged, as always).
2. Re-copy `relay.php` / `relay.mjs`. If you had edited constants in 1.0's `relay.php`, move them to a
   `relay.config.php`: `AIA_ALLOW_REMOTE` → `'allowRemote'`, `AIA_ALLOW_ANY_UPSTREAM` → `'allowAnyUpstream'`,
   `AIA_KEYS` → `'keys'`, `AIA_TIMEOUT` → `'timeout'`, `AIA_MAX_BODY` → `'limits' => ['maxBodyBytes' => …]`; an auth
   check you added in the file goes into `'authorize'`.
3. Behaviour changes to know about: typing in the drawer no longer reaches host key handlers (`isolateKeys: false`
   restores 1.0); the flag refreshes during continuous updates (`debounceMaxMs: 0` restores 1.0); dev warnings appear
   in the console on local hosts (`devWarnings: false`); the relay's GET answers 200 with `available: false` for
   clients it will not serve (was 403); in local mode, requests that came through a proxy (`X-Forwarded-For`…) are no
   longer treated as local — a local dev proxy in front of the relay needs `allowRemote`.
4. Remove app-side workarounds the runtime now covers: your own `contextChanged` throttle, dialog/`showModal`
   switching code (use `dialogs: 'dock'`), keydown filters for the drawer, a pre-mount relay probe (use `relayProbe`).
